# Die-Roll
Hi, is just a little and simple program. 
You choose a number (with a minimum of 100 for great calcul) and the program choose a random number betwin 1 and 6 (the faces 
of a die) the same time that you'v ask to do. 
He show you finally the percentage of apparition of each numbers (= each faces of a die obviously ^^).

Enjoy ;)

PS: I'm not a professional of C++ so, it can have errors, something I can do better or other things so if you found something
like that tell me ;)
